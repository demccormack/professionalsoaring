        <h1>CUP to KMZ Converter</h1>
        <p>.cup files store waypoint data and can be read by most gliding flight computer programs. 
            One great way to learn an unfamiliar area before you go flying in it, especially if it is mountainous,
                is to use Google Earth. In the 3D mode, you can fly yourself through a pass, sink down into the 
                valley, and see your landing area from circuit height. All from your armchair with no adrenaline.
        </p><p>
            But Google Earth can't read your cup file, so I wrote this script to convert it to a kmz archive. 
            You'll need to install the <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/versions/">desktop version</a> of Google Earth.

            Upload your .cup file: 
            <input type="file" name="cupfile" id="fileinput">
            <br><br>
            <input type="submit">
        </form>
        <output id="output"></output>
