                        This file is updated at least once a year so make sure you have the latest one and do 
                        not use a file from any other source as these are not updated so frequently. Note the

                        The file consists of landing places, mountain passes and mountain tops followed by the NZ VFR reporting 
                        points (from the GNZ website.) 
                        But BE WARNED - most of the airstrips in my file have 
                        not been verified by actually landing there. Some of the landing places are not airstrips 
                        at all, but simply the place likely to do the least amount of damage to your glider and yourself, should 
                        you have to land in the vicinity (e.g. L911 Arawhata River Bed!) Read the comments in the file 
                        and do your own research.</td>
