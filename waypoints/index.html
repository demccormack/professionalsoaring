        <h1>Omarama Waypoints</h1>
        <p>Get the official Omarama waypoint file from the Gliding New Zealand 
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://gliding.co.nz/pilots/pilot-resources/turnpoint-databases/">website</a>. 
            This file is updated at least once a year so make sure you have the latest one and do 
            not use a file from any other source as these are not updated so frequently. Note the 
            disclaimers on the GNZ website.
        </p>
        <p>I maintain my own collection of <a href="DanOAextras.cup">additional waypoints</a> which I find useful. 
            The file consists of landing places, mountain passes and mountain tops followed by the NZ VFR reporting 
            points (from the GNZ website.) 
            The disclaimer warning here is even more severe than for the GNZ file - DO NOT rely on these points as 
            landing areas without doing your own research. Most of the airstrips in my file have 
            not been verified by actually landing there. Some of the landing places are not airstrips 
            at all, but simply the place likely to do the least amount of damage to your glider and yourself, should 
            you have to land in the vicinity (e.g. L911 Arawhata River Bed!) Read the comments in the file 
            and do your own research.
